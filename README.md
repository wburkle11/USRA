# USRA / Quantum Compatible Machine Learning Model for Wildfire Forecasting

Code in this repository was used for downloading and managing a number of remote satellite data-sets. Additionally, code was written to prepare and verify how informative this data will be in our machine learning modelling framework. Data-sets found in this repository are listed below. 

- GOES- 16/17 for near-real-time data retrieval and processing.  
- DEM data for United States topographical data. 
- VIIRS wildfire data from NOAA-20 satellite. 
- ERA5 atmospheric wind and weather data
